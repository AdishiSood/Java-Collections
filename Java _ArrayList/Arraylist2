/*
You are given  lines. In each line there are zero or more integers. You need to answer a few queries where you need to tell the number located in  position of  line.

Take your input from System.in.

Input Format
The first line has an integer . In each of the next  lines there will be an integer  denoting number of integers on that line and then there will be  space-separated integers. In the next line there will be an integer  denoting number of queries. Each query will consist of two integers  and .

Constraints

Each number will fit in signed integer.
Total number of integers in  lines will not cross .

Output Format
In each line, output the number located in  position of  line. If there is no such position, just print "ERROR!"
